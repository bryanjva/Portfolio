Inspired by the annual Spotify Wrapped, I decided to do my own version as an exercise in handling and visualizing data. I downloaded a copy of my streaming history from Spotify, added missing metadata with the help of MusicBrainz API and created a Folium Choropleth map highliting the most frequent countries of origin in the list.
